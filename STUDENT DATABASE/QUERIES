Find the names of all Juniors (level = JR) who are enrolled in a class taught by Harish.
select distinct s.sname
from student s, class c, enrolled e, faculty f

Find the names of all classes that either meet in room R128 or have five or more Students enrolled.
select C.cname
from Class C
where C.room = 'R128'
or C.cname in (select E.cname
        FROM Enrolled E
        GROUP BY E.cname
        HAVING COUNT(E.snum) >= 5);



Find the names of all students who are enrolled in two classes that meet at the same time.
select distinct S.sname
from Student S
where S.snum in (select E1.snum
            from Enrolled E1, Enrolled E2, Class C1, Class C2
            where E1.snum = E2.snum AND E1.cname <> E2.cname
            AND E1.cname = C1.cname
            AND E2.cname = C2.cname AND C1.metts_at = C2.metts_at);

Find the names of faculty members who teach in every room in which some class is taught.

group by C.fid
having count(distinct room) = 5;



Find the names of faculty members for whom the combined enrollment of the courses that they teach is less than five.
select distinct F.fname
from Faculty F

and C.fid = F.fid);

Find the names of students who are not enrolled in any class. 

select distinct S.sname

where S.snum NOT IN (select E.snum
from Enrolled E );

For each age value that appears in Students, find the level value that appears most often. For example, if there are more FR level students aged 18 than SR, JR, or SO students aged 18, you should print the pair (18, FR).
select S.age, S.lvl
from Student S
group by S.age, S.lvl
having S.lvl IN (select S1.lvl from Student S1
      where S1.age = S.age
group by S1.lvl, S1.age
having COUNT(S1.snum) >= ALL (select COUNT(S2.snum)
from Student S2
where s1.age = S2.age
group by S2.lvl, S2.age));
